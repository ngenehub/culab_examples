# Heat Equation Solver - CuLab vs lvgpu
This project demonstrates the difference between implementing GPU-accelerated code in LabVIEW using [CuLab](https://www.ngene.co/gpu-toolkit-for-labview) and the [NI GPU Analysis Toolkit](https://www.vipm.io/package/national_instruments_lib_ni_gpu_analysis_toolkit_64_bit/).
More infromation on the analysis of the benchmark can be found in [blog post](https://www.ngene.co/post/culab-gpu-toolkit-for-labview-simplicity-performance-and-functionality).
